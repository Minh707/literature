#When I was a teacher in a remote virgin forest I thought I would hold the hands of students and step into the future until I got lost here, Bong but I heard a loud echoing sound. forest a sound that scares everyone when it's played, It's the sound of wolves hunting and I realize I'm the target of a hit, Eyes like bullets light up in my direction , I was taught how to avoid the wolf, But in that situation I couldn't think more, I rushed straight into the nearby village and yelled out loud screams in panic,I thought I was saved but maybe I was wrong thinking it was the village because it was just high rocks, I was scared so scared and cried and accepted my fate that mik would be the supper for wild wolves hey, suddenly there was an explosion followed by the scent of gunpowder, i lost consciousness for a few seconds and i just figured it was you and maybe i was saved
